Running notebooks
=================

The best way to get familiar with RASCIL is via jupyter notebooks. For example::

   jupyter examples/notebooks/imaging.ipynb


See the jupyter note books below:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   examples/notebooks/imaging.rst
   examples/notebooks/imaging-wterm_rsexecute.rst
   examples/notebooks/simple-dask_rsexecute.rst
   examples/notebooks/imaging-pipelines_rsexecute.rst
   examples/notebooks//bandpass-calibration_rsexecute.rst

In addition, there are other notebooks in examples/notebooks that are not built as part of this documentation.
