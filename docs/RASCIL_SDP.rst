The role of the RASCIL in SDP
*****************************

RASCIL was developed in SDP under the name ARL (Algorithm Reference Library). The emphasis was on creating reference versions of standard algorithms.

For an overview of the SDP see the `SDP CDR
documentation <http://ska-sdp.org/publications/sdp-cdr-closeout-documentation>`_

The ARL/RASCIL structure maps that used in the SDP processing architecture:

For clarity, not all connections are shown in this diagram.

Subsequent to the conclusion of the SDP project, it became clear that ARL could play a larger role that being just a reference library. Hence it was renamed to the Radio Astronomy Simulation, Calibration and Imaging Library (RASCIL).
