Fourier processing
******************

There are many algorithms for imaging, using different approaches to correct for various effects:

+ Simple 2D transforms
+ Partitioned image (i.e. faceted) and uv transforms
+ W projection
+ W snapshots
+ W slices
+ A projection variants
+ Visibility coalescence and de-coalescence
+ MFS variants

Since the scale of SKA is so much larger than previous telescopes, it is not clear which scaling strategies and
algorithms are going to offer the best performance. For this reason, it is important the synthesis framework not be
restrictive.

All the above functions are linear in the visibilities and image. The 2D transform is correct for sufficiently
restricted context. Hence we layer all algorithms on top of the 2D transform. This means that a suitable
framework decomposes the overall transform into suitable linear combinations of invocations of 2D transforms.

The full layering is:

+ The core 2d imaging functions are defined in :py:mod:`processing_components.imaging.base`. W projection is included
    at this level by setting wstep to the desired non-zero value.

+ Other algorithms (e.g. timeslice and wstack) are implemented as workflowss using the core 2d imaging functions.
    These are defined in :py:mod:`workflows.serial.imaging.imaging_serial` and
    :py:mod:`workflows.rsexecute.imaging.imaging_rsexecute`

The style of first approach is::

        m31model=create_test_image()
        for ipatch in image_raster_iter(m31model, facets=4):
            # each image patch can be used to add to the visibility data
            vis.data['vis'] += predict_2d(vis, ipatch).data['vis'].data

This relies upon the data objects (model and vis) possessing sufficient meta data to enable operations such as phase
rotation from one frame to another.

The second approach is based on the same underlying functions, predict_2d and invert_2d but encapsulates the looping
of the above example::

        m31model=create_test_image()
        vis = predict_list_serial_workflow(vis, m31model, context='facets', nfacets=4)

The third approach implements imaging via rsexecute::

        m31model_component = rsexecute.execute(create_test_image)()
        vis_component = rsexecute(vis_scatter_time)(vis, timeslice='auto')
        vis_component = predict_component(vis_component, m31component_component, facets=4)

This form may be executed immediately::

        rsexecute.set_client(use_dask=False)
        m31model_component = rsexecute.execute(create_test_image)()
        vis_component = rsexecute(vis_scatter_time)(vis, timeslice='auto')
        vis_component = predict_component(vis_component, m31component_component, facets=4)

Or delayed::

        rsexecute.set_client(use_dask=True)
        m31model_component = rsexecute.execute(create_test_image)()
        vis_component = rsexecute(vis_scatter_time)(vis, timeslice='auto')
        vis_component = predict_component(vis_component, m31component_component, facets=4)
        vis_component = rsexecute.compute(vis_component, sync=True)
