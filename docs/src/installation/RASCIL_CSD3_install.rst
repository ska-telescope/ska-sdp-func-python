Installation of RASCIL on CSD3
==============================

RASCIL is well-suited to running on CSD3. Installation should be straightforward. We strongly recommend the use of a python virtual environment. Follow the generic installation steps.

We recommend that RASCIL be installed on one of the preferred storage systems e.g. /rds/user/hpccorn1/hpc-work/rascil
