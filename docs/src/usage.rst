==============

Calibration
-----------

Calibration control is via a calibration_controls dictionary
created by :py:func:`ska_sdp_func_python.calibration.chain_calibration.create_calibration_controls`.
This supports the following Jones matrices::

   . T - Atmospheric phase
   . G - Electronics gain
   . P - Polarisation
   . B - Bandpass
   . I - Ionosphere

This is specified via a dictionary::

    contexts = {'T': {'shape': 'scalar', 'timeslice': 'auto',
                        'phase_only': True, 'first_iteration': 0},
                'G': {'shape': 'vector', 'timeslice': 60.0,
                        'phase_only': False, 'first_iteration': 0},
                'P': {'shape': 'matrix', 'timeslice': 1e4,
                        'phase_only': False, 'first_iteration': 0},
                'B': {'shape': 'vector', 'timeslice': 1e5,
                        'phase_only': False, 'first_iteration': 0},
                'I': {'shape': 'vector', 'timeslice': 1.0,
                        'phase_only': True, 'first_iteration': 0}}

Currently P and I are not supported.

For example::

    controls = create_calibration_controls()

    controls['T']['first_selfcal'] = 1
    controls['T']['phase_only'] = True
    controls['T']['timeslice'] = 'auto'

    controls['G']['first_selfcal'] = 3
    controls['G']['timeslice'] = 'auto'

    controls['B']['first_selfcal'] = 4
    controls['B']['timeslice'] = 1e5

    ical_list = ical_list_rsexecute_workflow(vis_list,
                                              model_imagelist=future_model_list,
                                              context='wstack', vis_slices=51,
                                              scales=[0, 3, 10], algorithm='mmclean',
                                              nmoment=3, niter=1000,
                                              fractional_threshold=0.1,
                                              threshold=0.1, nmajor=5, gain=0.25,
                                              deconvolve_facets=1,
                                              deconvolve_overlap=0,
                                              deconvolve_taper='tukey',
                                              timeslice='auto',
                                              psf_support=64,
                                              global_solution=False,
                                              calibration_context='TGB',
                                              do_selfcal=True)


Calibration solvers are via substitution algorithm due to
Larry D'Addario c 1980'ish. Used in the original VLA Dec-10 Antsol.

For example::

    gtsol = solve_gaintable(vis, originalvis,
            phase_only=True, niter=niter, crosspol=False, tol=1e-6)
    vis = apply_gaintable(vis, gtsol, inverse=True)

Fourier Transforms
------------------

All grids and images are considered quadratic and centered around
`npixel//2`, where `npixel` is the pixel width/height.
This means that `npixel//2` is the zero frequency for FFT purposes,
as is convention. Note that this means that for even `npixel` the
grid is not symmetrical, which means that e.g. for convolution
kernels odd image sizes are preferred.

Gridding
--------

Imaging is based on use of the FFT to perform Fourier transforms
efficiently. Since the observed visibility data_models
do not arrive naturally on grid points, the sampled points are
resampled on the FFT grid using a convolution function to
smear out the sample points. The resulting grid points are then FFT'ed.
The result can be corrected for the griddata convolution function by
division in the image plane of the transform.

This module contains functions for performing the
griddata process and the inverse degridding process.

The GridData data model is used to hold the specification
of the desired result.

GridData, ConvolutionFunction and Vis
always have the same PolarisationFrame. Conversion to
stokesIQUV is only done in the image plane.

Image
-----

These are functions that aid Fourier transform processing.
These are built on top of the core functions in
:py:func:`ska_sdp_func_python.fourier_transforms`.

The measurement equation for a sufficiently narrow
field of view interferometer is:

 .. math::

     V(u,v,w) =\\int I(l,m) e^{-2 \\pi j (ul+vm)} dl dm


The measurement equation for a wide field of view interferometer is:

 .. math::

     V(u,v,w) =\\int \\frac{I(l,m)}{\\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}}
         e^{-2 \\pi j (ul+vm + w(\\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1))} dl dm

This and related modules contain various approaches for dealing with
the wide-field problem where the extra phase term in the Fourier
transform cannot be ignored.

The standard deconvolution algorithms are provided by
:py:func:`ska_sdp_func_python.imaging.cleaners`.

For example to make dirty image and PSF, deconvolve, and then restore::

    model = create_image_from_visibility(vt, cellsize=0.001, npixel=256)
    dirty, sumwt = invert_visibility(vt, model, context="2d")
    psf, sumwt = invert_visibility(vt, model, context="2d", dopsf=True)

    comp, residual = deconvolve_cube(dirty, psf, niter=1000, threshold=0.001,
                        fracthresh=0.01, window_shape='quarter',
                        gain=0.7, algorithm='msclean', scales=[0, 3, 10, 30])

    restored = restore_cube(comp, psf, residual)

All functions return an image holding clean components and residual image.

Imaging
-----------

The imaging functions include 2D prediction and inversion operations.
A very simple example, given a model Image to specify the
image size, sampling, and phasecentre::

    model = create_image_from_visibility(vis, npixel=1024, nchan=1)
    dirty, sumwt = invert_visibility(vis, model, context="2d")

The call to create_image_from_visibility step constructs a template image.
The dirty image is constructed according to this template.

AW projection is supported by the predict_visibility and invert_visibility methods,
provided the gridding kernel is constructed and passed in as a partial.
For example::

    gcfcf = functools.partial(create_awterm_convolutionfunction, nw=100, wstep=8.0,
            oversampling=8, support=100, use_aaf=True)
    dirty, sumwt = invert_visibility(vis, model, context="awprojection", gcfcf=gcfcf)

If installed, the nifty gridder (https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/ift/nifty_gridder)
can also be used::

    dirty, sumwt = invert_visibility(vis, model, verbosity=2, context="ng")

The convolutional gridding functions are to be found in the grid_data module
