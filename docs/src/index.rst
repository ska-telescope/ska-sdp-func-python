SKA SDP Python Processing Functions
###################################
This `repository <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-func-python.git>`_
contains Processing Function wrappers implemented in Python. The original code was migrated
from `RASCIL <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/external/rascil-main.git>`_. They provide reference
implementations for lower-level processing function libraries, such as
`ska-sdp-func <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-func.git>`_
and an interface between these and high-level data models
(`ska-sdp-datamodel <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-datamodels.git>`_).


Installation Instructions
