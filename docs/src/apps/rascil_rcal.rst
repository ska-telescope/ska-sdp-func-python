rascil_rcal
===========

rascil_rcal is a command line app written using RASCIL. It simulates the real-time
calibration pipeline RCAL. In the SKA, an initial calibration is performed in
real-time as the visibility data are accumulated. An accurate sky model is
assumed to be available or a point source model is used.

In rascil_rcal an MeasurementSet is read in and then iterated through in time-order
solving for the gains. The gaintables are accumulated into a single gain table that is written
as an HDF file.

There is also an additional plotting function that plots the gaintable values
(gain amplitude, phase and residual) over time. If plotting is required,
please make sure you have the correct path `--plot_dir` set up.

RFI Flagger
+++++++++++

rascil_rcal also implements reading RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) flags
and using them as part of the pipeline. Flagging either occurs before any
other operations are performed, or after first calibration (set by the
`--flag_first` argument).

RASCIL's BlockVisibility object contains a "flags" data array with the same
dimensions as the visibilities. At the moment, this array is updated with
arbitrary data by a place-holder function. This function will eventually be replaced by
the SKA `Post-Correlation RFI Flagger <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/ska-post-correlation-rfi-flagger/-/tree/master>`.

Calibration (i.e. applying the gains to the input visibilities) is optional
in rascil_rcal and can be turned on via the `--calibrate_bvis` CLI argument.

Example script
++++++++++++++

The following runs the real time calibration pipeline on an MS generated by the
MID continuum imaging simulations (with an optional input components file)::

    #!/bin/bash
    python3 $RASCIL/rascil/apps/rascil_rcal.py \
    --ingest_msname SKA_MID_SIM_custom_B2_dec_-45.0_nominal_nchan100_actual.ms \
    --ingest_components_file SKA_MID_SIM_custom_B2_dec_-45.0_nominal_nchan100_components.hdf

There are also additional options if your want the sky model to have primary beams applied. Currently we support internal beam from MID and LOW, or additional beam file (in FITS format). An example::

    #!/bin/bash
    python3 $RASCIL/rascil/apps/rascil_rcal.py \
    --ingest_msname myms.ms \
    --ingest_components_file my_components.hdf \
    --apply_beam True --ingest_beam_file my_beam.fits \
