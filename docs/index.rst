Algorithm Reference Library
###########################

The Algorithm Reference Library expresses radio interferometry calibration and imaging algorithms in python and numpy.
The emphasis is on capturing the key algorithms and data models. The interfaces all operate with familiar data
structures such as image, visibility table, gaintable, etc. The source code is directly accessible from these
documentation pages: see the source link in the top right corner.
