Algorithm Reference Library
***************************

The Algorithm Reference Library expresses radio interferometry calibration and imaging algorithms. The emphasis is on
capturing the key algorithms and data models. The interfaces all operate with familiar data structures such as
image, visibility table, gaintable, etc.

The ARL structure maps that used in the SDP processing architecture:
