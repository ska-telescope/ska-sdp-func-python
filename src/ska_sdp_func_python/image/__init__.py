""" Functions for operations on Images, including creation, iteration, gather/scatter, FFTs, deconvolution, import/export, polarisation conversion, display, and frequency moments.

Some of these functions operate only on canonical images. A canonical image has 4 dimensional data array, and 4 axes: RA---SIN, DEC---SIN, STOKES, and FREQ.
