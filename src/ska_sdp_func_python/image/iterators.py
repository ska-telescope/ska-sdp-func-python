    """Create an image_raster_iter generator, returning a list of subimages, optionally with overlaps

    The WCS is adjusted appropriately for each raster element. Hence this is a coordinate-aware
    way to iterate through an image.

    The argument make_flat means that the subimages contain constant values. This is useful for
    dealing with overlaps in gather operations.

    Provided we don't break reference semantics, memory should be conserved. However make_flat
    creates a new set of images and thus reference semantics dont hold.

    To update the image in place::

        for r in image_raster_iter(im, facets=2):
            r["pixels"].data[...] = numpy.sqrt(r["pixels"].data[...])

    Note that some combinations of image size, facets, and overlap are invalid. In these cases,
    an exception (ValueError) is raised.

    In the case where make_flat is true, the subimages returned have tapers applied in the overlap
    region. This is used by py:func:`rascil.processing_components.image.gather_scatter.image_gather_facets`
    to merge subimages into one image.

    A taper is applied in the overlap regions. None implies a constant value, linear is a ramp,
    quadratic is parabolic at the ends, and tukey is the tukey function.

    :param im: Image
    :param facets: Number of image partitions on each axis (2)
    :param overlap: overlap in pixels
    :param taper: method of tapering at the edges: 'flat' or 'linear' or 'quadratic' or 'tukey'
