    """Create an image_raster_iter generator,
    returning a list of subimages, optionally with overlaps

     The WCS is adjusted appropriately for each raster element.
     Hence this is a coordinate-aware way to iterate through an image.

     The argument make_flat means that the subimages contain
     constant values. This is useful for dealing with overlaps
     in gather operations.

     Provided we don't break reference semantics, memory
     should be conserved. However make_flat creates a new set
     of images and thus reference semantics dont hold.

     To update the image in place::

         for r in image_raster_iter(im, facets=2):
             r["pixels"].data[...] = numpy.sqrt(r["pixels"].data[...])

     Note that some combinations of image size, facets,
     and overlap are invalid. In these cases,
     an exception (ValueError) is raised.

     In the case where make_flat is true, the subimages returned
     have tapers applied in the overlap region.
     This is used by py:func:`gather_scatter.image_gather_facets`
     to merge subimages into one image.

     A taper is applied in the overlap regions.
     None implies a constant value, linear is a ramp,
     quadratic is parabolic at the ends, and tukey is the tukey function.

    :param im: Image
    :param facets: Number of image partitions on each axis (2)
    :param overlap: overlap in pixels
    :param taper: method of tapering at the edges:
                    'flat' or 'linear' or 'quadratic' or 'tukey'
